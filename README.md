    - Sports
    - Local Programming

    - Current
    - Rerun


Plan Rules:

* Trial Plan can watch any content until trial expires
* Gold Plan can watch any content
* Silver Plan can watch any content, except Sports subcategory
* Free Plan can watch on-demand reruns only

Kata Rules:

Create a user store
Create a content store

Create a service that returns "playing [category][name]...." or "upgrade your plan to access this content"
depending on the users plan, e.g., "playing Live Stream:  Sports - UM vs Ohio State"

Verify all plan rules (business rules) are accounted for so no one is able to stream content that does not fit their plan
